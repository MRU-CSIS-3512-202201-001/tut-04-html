# tut-04-html

The `index.html` in this repo is the one you'll use for tut-04. You should get familiar with it.

*Figure out ahead of time what CSS selectors you would use to select*:

- the `<h2>`
- the element with id="specialPara"
- the second `<article>`
- the text input with name "hex"
- all `<p>` tags that are DIRECT children of "box" class elements
- every `<p>` within the first `<article>`. You might want to refresh your memory regarding the **first-of-type** pseudo-class
- every text input
- the button
- all `<p>` tags
- all "box" class elements

_Practice using the console to try your selectors out ahead of time - that would be time well-spent!_
